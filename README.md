# Project-1
Explanation :
Structure of Project:
The code begins with a tag that contains two child tags: one for the main content of the page, and another for the navigation.

 The first thing you see is a pair of tags.

 The first one displays a name of website i.e EcommerceStore.com, while the second one displays a search icon.

 This will be used to help users find what they’re looking for on the site.

 Inside of that holds all of the content on the page, you’ll see a series of paragraphs.

 The first paragraph contains information about how to purchase items from this store.

 It includes details like product categories and prices.

 The next paragraph lists all of the available products in each category.

 Each product has its own row, and there are images associated with each item so that users can better understand what they’re buying.

You also include links to more detailed descriptions if needed.

Finally, at the bottom of this paragraph is a link to view additional product information (such as dimensions and materials).

Next comes a section where users can search for products by keyword or phrase.

The code creates a div with the class navItem, which will house all of the navigation for our ecommerce store.

Within this div, we have two elements: a search input and an icon for our search bar.

The code within the search input will allow users to enter text into the form and it will be autofilled with the current page’s title.

The icon will be used as a placeholder for our search bar and it will dynamically change depending on whether or not there is any content in our search input.

Finally, we have created a div with the class navItem which will house all of our navigation.

Within this div, we have created a heading titled “Ecommerce Store” and beneath this heading

JavaScript Logic :

The code starts by creating an array of objects called products .

Each object in the products array will contain information about a different product.

The first object in the products array is called choosen Product .

This object will hold the information about the product that was chosen by the user (in this case, it’s Air Jordan).

Next, we need to get hold of all of the information about choosen Product .

We do this by using document.querySelectorAll() .

This method takes two arguments: The first is a selector (in this case, “.productTitle”) and the second is a list of strings (in this case, “.color”).

We then use forEach() to loop through all of the menuItems in our document.

Each time around the loop, we’ll add an event listener to each item so that we can track when it’s clicked.

In this case, when someone clicks on one of our menuItems , we want to run a function called analyze() .

This function will take three arguments: The first is choosenProduct , which we’ve already obtained from earlier; secondly, currentProductImg , which is our image pointer for displaying what’s currently being displayed on our screen; and finally, current

The code creates a slider with six different products.

Each product has an id, title, price, and colors.

The code also creates a menu item for each product.

When the user clicks on any of the menu items, the code will call a function that will take care of the rest.

The first thing that the function does is find the product that was clicked on.

This is done by using the index variable which refers to the particular menu item that was clicked on.

Once it finds the product, it sets up some event handlers for it so that when it is clicked again or when something else happens in the slider, it will be triggered.

The event handlers are used to change some variables in regard to each of the products.
